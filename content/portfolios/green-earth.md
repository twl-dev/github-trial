This event focused on Section 4 of the MacLehose Trail, where erosion has widened the trail due to soil loss. Over forty volunteers participated in this activity, which took place over two days to restore a segment of the trail. The materials used for the repairs were sourced from trees that were blown down by Typhoon Mangkhut, demonstrating a commitment to recycling waste.
